### getting started

- ensure you're all setup to run a [tauri app](https://tauri.app/v1/guides/getting-started/setup/next-js/)
- run `npm install` from the root of the project
- go into the `src` folder and also run `npm install` (I don't think we need this step but can't confirm right now)
- from the root of the project run `cargo tauri dev`
